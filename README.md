### Informations

When a domain doesn't have Office365, this robust script filters it out and looks for Microsoft accounts to see if they are admin or user accounts. You can depend on the security of it because the source code is published. The script then identifies the businesses offering these accounts, such as "Goddady," and records the findings in a document called MS-"DATE-TIME". Thank you !
